# corrust
experimental file corruptor written in rust (sorry)

I was learning rust despite my misgivings with the language and stuff surrounding it, and figured I'd make a simple file corruptor with egui to learn the language better.
Surprisingly, I found rust "just ok", which is better than I expected.
So, here that file corruptor is.
